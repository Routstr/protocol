# RIP-03: Web Dashboard

This document defines a fully client-side, 100% local web or app interface for provider discovery, chat, proxy interaction and wallet management.
There is no backend: all logic and data flow run in the user's browser or device. The frontend includes a chat application, discovery interface, landing page, and documentation. Authentication and filtering leverage Nostr for login and social graph-based filtering. Users can publish their own node information or interact with available nodes directly from the interface.
