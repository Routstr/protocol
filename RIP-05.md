# RIP-05: SDKs & Smart Clients

This RIP proposes a comprehensive suite of SDKs and Smart Client libraries across multiple programming languages, enabling seamless integration with the protocol and ensuring robust privacy, payment, and provider management.

## Scope

- Multi-language SDKs: Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, Go, Rust, and others as needed.
- Full-stack implementations for:
  - Client
  - Server
  - Discovery
  - Evaluation Server
  - Chat API
- Unified interfaces for Cashu wallet management, API key rotation, and proxy/anonymity features.

## Components

### 1. SDKs

- Provide idiomatic libraries in each language for all protocol operations.
- Expose high-level abstractions for:
  - Token management (Cashu wallets)
  - API key rotation
  - Provider selection and scoring
  - Proxy/Tor integration for request anonymization
  - Secure, stateless request/response flows

### 2. Smart Clients

- Automated token cycling and top-up from Cashu wallets.
- Per-request API key rotation and proxy/Tor circuit selection.
- Dynamic provider discovery and scoring (price, latency, rating, reliability).
- Pluggable architecture for custom scoring, proxy, or wallet backends.

### 3. Server & Discovery

- Reference implementations for server, discovery, and evaluation endpoints in each supported language.
- Standardized APIs for provider registration, health, and metrics reporting.

### 4. Evaluation Server & Chat API

- Modular evaluation server for benchmarking and rating providers.
- Chat API reference implementations for real-time and batch inference.

## Privacy & Security

- Built-in support for proxy and Tor routing in all SDKs and clients.
- Automated rotation of API keys and tokens to minimize linkability.
- Rate limiting and circuit rotation to prevent fingerprinting.

## Implementation Plan

- Define core protocol interfaces and data models in each language.
- Develop and maintain open-source SDKs and reference servers.
- Ensure feature parity and cross-language test suites.
- Document integration patterns and privacy best practices.
